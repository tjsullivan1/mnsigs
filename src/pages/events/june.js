    <h2>Details</h2>
    <ul>

      <li>What: Ritual Chapter Meeting</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Join us for our first Ritual Chapter Meeting!<br />
Bonfire/ hotdog cookout to follow.<br />
Found out that as long as it's more or less a couple per and everyone is responsible for both cleanup and getting home safely, beer/wine/cider is permitted! BYOB, food provided. After the ritual meeting, obviously. <br />
Also, it CAN get buggy if the wind isn't blowing, recommend bugspray.<br />
Doors at 5:30p, doors will close at 6:00p, if you can't make the ritual portion, come for the bonfire/hotdogs at 7p!</p><br/>
